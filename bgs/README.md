<h1>The British Government Securities Database</h1>

<h3>Heriot-Watt / Institute and Faculty of Actuaries / ESCoE British Government Securities Database</h3>
<p>For many years Heriot-Watt University and the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries hosted a historical database on British Government Securities which was constructed and maintained by Andrew Cairns and David Wilkie. As of 2024, curation of the database is being passed to the Historical Data UK Repository at the Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence. For more details please consult the ESCoE blog from February 2024. Queries about the database should now be addressed to ryland.thomas@bankofengland.co.uk</p>

<p>The dataset itself consists of spreadsheets that capture monthly quantities (from 1964) and prices (from 1975) of every gilt issued by the British Government up until the present. This allows an analysis of the gilt portfolio in terms of both nominal and market values and allows the construction of statistics on maturity and duration to be calculated according to the researcherâ€™s needs. The third spreadsheet contains a historical record from 1975 of the FTSE Actuaries UK Gilts Indices to which David Wilkie and Andrew Cairns made important contributions.</p>
